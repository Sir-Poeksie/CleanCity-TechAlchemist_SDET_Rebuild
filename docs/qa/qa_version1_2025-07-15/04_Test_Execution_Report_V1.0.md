# Final Test Execution Report – CleanCity Waste Scheduler

**Version:** 1.0
**Execution Period:** 2025-07-13 to 2025-07-15  
**Prepared by:** Mpumelelo Theophilas Nxazonke  

## Introduction

This document summarizes the **Preliminary Test Execution** of the CleanCity Waste Scheduler project. It includes results from both **unit tests (Jest)** and **end-to-end tests using Cypress** executed between **2025-07-13 and 2025-07-15**. The goal was to validate core functionality, form validations, navigation, user flows, and UI rendering.

## Detailed Jest Results

| Test Suite         | Status | Notes |
|--------------------|--------|-------|
| Login.test.js      | Failed | Missing `role="alert"` element |
| Dashboard.test.js  | Pass | Renders dashboard metrics |
| PickupForm.test.js | Fail | Component not found (import fails) |
| BlogAdmin.test.js  | Pass | Nested form warning |
| CommunityFeed.js   | Pass | DOM renders cleanly |
| Awareness.test.js  | Pass | UI components render |
| BlogArticle.test.js| Pass | Uses `BrowserRouter` context |
| App.test.js        | Pass | Passed render smoke test |
| index.test.js      | Failed | Import path broken |
| Admin.test.js      | Pass | Admin summary renders |

### Code Coverage (Jest)

| **Metric** | **% Coverage** |
|--------------|------------|
| Statements | 54.63% |
| Branches | 35.94% |
| Functions | 47.61% |
| Lines | 56.45% |

> **Note**: Branch and statements coverage is low. Testing priority should focus on business logic (e.g., dataService.js, PickupForm, Dashboard).

## Conclusion

- Despite multiple passing tests in authentication, admin, and navigation, several critical flows in pickup scheduling, feedback submission, and profile access **failed due to missing elements or improper validations**.
- Most modules passed automated testing. Bugs found in filters, feedback, pickup,  and profile routing. Coverage acceptable. Regression required post-fixes.
- **Critical Flows Tested:** Registration, Login, Admin Management, Feedback, Navigation
- **Core Issues Detected:** Broken form renders, incorrect DOM selectors, missing accessibility roles
- **Overall QA Status:** *Partially Passed* – functional issues remain in multiple user journeys
- **Recommendation:** Prioritize defect fixes before release. Increase coverage and stabilize DOM render timing for Cypress.
