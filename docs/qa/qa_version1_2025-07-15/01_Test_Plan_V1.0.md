## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the test planning activities, scope, strategy, schedule, resources, and entry/exit criteria for testing the CleanCity Waste Pickup Scheduler application. The purpose is to ensure structured and traceable QA processes aligned with the STLC model.

### 1.2 Objective

The objective is to validate that the CleanCity application meets its specified functional and non-functional requirements, is user-friendly, and performs reliably across supported platforms and browsers.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Pickup Request Form                 | Field validation, scheduling logic, error states  |
| Dashboard Filtering                 | Filter accuracy, status labels, sorting bugs      |
| Feedback Page                       | Form validation, request ID checks                |
| Admin Panel                         | Request status updates, data display              |
| Notifications                       | Unread count, alert types                         |
| Accessibility                       | Alt-text, tab order, contrast                     |
| Responsive Design                   | Layout integrity across screen sizes              |

### 2.2 Out of Scope

| Area                                | Rationale                                          |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Backend/API testing                 | No backend (localStorage only)                     |
| Real-time updates                   | Not supported in current architecture              |
| Performance under high load         | Client-side only; no server stress testing possible|

**For Scope please refer to:** [Software Requirements Specification Documentation](../final_docs/SRS.md)

## 3. Test Approach

### 3.1 Testing Methods

| Type             | Details                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manual Testing   | UI/UX testing, form validation, edge cases, exploratory testing     |
| Automated Testing| Core logic using Jest; UI flow via Cypress where feasible           |

### 3.2 Testing Techniques

- **Black-box Testing**: Functional validation (UI behavior, field validation)
- **White-box Testing**: Coverage of pure logic functions (e.g. localStorage interaction)
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Input length, date boundaries
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Valid/Invalid inputs for scheduling and login
- **Decision Table Testing**: Request approval logic (Admin module)

**For Test Cases Design refer to:** [Test Case.md](../final_docs/Test_Cases.md)

| Jest              | Unit testing of logic functions    |
| Cypress           | Automated E2E flows (UI testing)   |
| Lighthouse        | Accessibility, performance audits  |
| Chrome DevTools   | Manual UI/console testing          |
| GitHub Projects   | Task management and issue tracking |
| VS Code           | Development & test script writing  |

## Review & Execution Context

> *Note:* Due to repeated non-participation and lack of communication from assigned team members, this Test Plan has been drafted and finalized by the QA Team Lead.
> All outlined tasks, coverage, and schedules reflect the solo execution of this QA cycle under academic and professional obligations.
